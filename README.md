# semantic_sql_testing

This new GitHub repository offers a benchmark for Large Language Models (LLMs) in SQL generation. It features a well-defined semantic model, comprising verified SQL queries and sample values, which enables the generation of accurate SQL from natural language questions for evaluation. Initial benchmarks were performed using Qwen3-4B local, GPT-4o, and Gemini Flash 2.5
